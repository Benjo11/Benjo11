- 👋 Hi, I’m Dhenmar, the creator of Bordz Coin (contract address: 0x51715f55c3ec1eaaf6f2c98d11f76f1487ab98f7).
- 🌱 I mainly use Solidity, the programming language of Ethereum and the Binance Smart Chain for smart contracts.
- 🌱 I am knowledgeable on cypto tokenomics and generally understand the intricacies of decentralized finance projects.
- 💞️ My collaborators and I are currently working on an NFT game that will utilize Bordz Coin as the base currency.
- 💞️ I’m looking to contribute to other projects that can also use Bordz Coin as some form of medium of exchange.
- 📫 DM me on twitter @dhenmarchua for project ideas, and for suggestions to Bordz Coin development.
